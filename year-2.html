            It was 8 am or maybe later. Does the time really matter? Moving on, the uditorium wasn’t too bad. 
            It wasn’t cold or too warm. But the desks were small, my notebook definitely didn’t fit on the desk. 
            Professor - whatever his name is - is talking and drawing diagrams. And I suppose I should pay attention, 
            I muse to myself. 
            <br><br>But it’s just the beginning of the semester, I still have some time don’t I. And it doesn’t seem 
            too bad, as long as I study afterward, I rationalize. I have been on my phone way too much, well Instagram. 
            And no one is replying back. I guess I’ll take a break. I look around the auditorium and it’s packed. 
            <br><br>How many students really plan on doing electrical engineering or computer engineering? Every morning since 
            the first class, I familiarized myself with who was in front of me on the left side and the center. I recognized 
            everyone - well their faces, despite the masks. And today was different, seeing as someone with a cap was sitting 
            in the center, one of the front rows. I wondered how they looked. Well, I wouldn’t be able to see how they looked now. 
            And they were actively taking notes, so they were studious for sure, unlike me.<br><br>It was time to take notes. 
        </p>

        <p>
            It’s the next day. And it’s time for physics. Physics - the bane of my existence. Physics one was a nightmare. 
            Physics two is plain torture. It’s only a few weeks in, and I’m terribly lost. I think maybe I’m just not cut out 
            to be an engineer.  But then again, it’s not like I’m trying. But the thing is, I’ve tried when I’m with myself 
            to learn and understand. And it just doesn’t make any sense. Even while doing the homework as well. 
            <br><br>Let’s not even talk about the quizzes. Those were a nightmare, absolute nightmares. I see I’m a liar; and 
            we are indeed talking about the quizzes. I didn’t think it was possible, but I managed to make it possible. 
            I got a 2/10 on my first quiz. Absolutely wonderful. <br><br>My second quiz I managed to outdo myself, and get 
            1.5/10. It says on the syllabus that only the two lowest quizzes get dropped. And right now, I’m just thinking how 
            I can do any worse. But I know myself, and I’ll most likely get a 0 on my next quiz. I’m definitely not fit to be 
            an engineer. Maybe I should give up on my future already. <br><br>Ok, no. That’s terrible thinking. I can’t just 
            give up already. It’s still September. First month in, and I’m thinking of giving up. Shame on me. <br><br>Ok, let’s 
            try to focus on physics while crying on the inside. I turn off my phone and get ready to write down whatever 
            Professor - whatever his name is number two - drew, when I catch sight of a cap. <br><br>
            I turn my head slightly. <br><br> And no fucking way. <br><br> I think it’s cap boy from circuit class. But I am not sure. <br><br>
            I’m a fucking idiot for sure. But this requires an investigation. Forget physics; it’s not as important as this. <br><br>
            Maybe I’ll regret saying that. I don’t know. 
        </p>

        <div id="f2021e3"><em>entry # 3</em></div>
        <p>
            Okay, so it’s now a few days later. So I noticed him - I sound like such a fucking creep - before and after class for a few days. 
            And I’m pretty sure he’s in both of my classes.<br><br>But a good investigation needs evidence. So I’ll prove this with evidence. 
            I noticed one day he carried a tote bag. And the next day, he brought a backpack. I waited a few more days, and it’s the same backpack.
            I’m not sure how it makes sense, but he’s definitely the same boy, in both my physics class and circuits class. And I don’t know why, 
            but now I just want to be friends with him.<br><br>It’s like how I wanted to be friends with A in junior year of highschool. I really wanted 
            to be friends with her. And despite social anxiety, I did it and started talking to her. And now we’re really good friends.<br><br>The problem 
            is my social anxiety. It’s a fucking mess, and loves to mess with me. I keep on telling myself I’ll ask after class if he’s also taking physics.
            But that doesn’t go well. I’m like okay this day for sure. And it doesn’t happen. And the next time, too. I stay a little bit longer to ask. 
            <br><br>But I’m a coward, but we all know that. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Okay. It’s wednesday, October 6. I’m in physics. And my stomach is swarming with butterflies, moths, everything. I’m feeling very anxious. 
            And I still want to be friends with him. But I’m a mess, not the pretty kind, which would make it more tolerable. But then again, the universe 
            has never been in my favor. <br><br>Ok, I’ll ask before class. I tell this to myself and repeat it over and over again. And he sits down in the 
            seat beside me, though there is space. But same point. I’m pushing myself to ask. And then Professor - well I'm not going to say the whole 
            thing again, frankly it takes too much effort to write and I am most definitely lazy - starts speaking. <br><br> To tell you the truth, I’m not 
            surprised. I’m a pity case. <br><br> -- <br><br> Finally it’s break time. Break time is like my savior. I cannot go too long thinking of physics 
            without going insane.<br><br>I really want to ask and ask. But social anxiety has me in a steel grip. Okay, you know what. Fuck it. Screw it. I’m
            also really glad we have to wear masks, so he can’t see me turn red. And it’s not pretty. <br><br>  I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I turn to my side, 
            lean a bit forward and tap my knuckles on the desk. And he’s turning around. <br><br>Here it goes. “Do you, um, um, um -” <br><br>Gods, I’m such an 
            embarrassment. “- take -” what’s that class called “- uh, uh, uh -” <br><br> My face is burning red. Thank God we wear masks otherwise I would die 
            right there. <br><br>“- circuits -” that’s the class! “- with Professor - -” <br><br> He nods his head. So the investigation proved right as
            embarrassing as it was. <br><br> “I thought you looked familiar.” is the last thing I say before break ends. <br><br>Well, at least I got it over 
            with. I’m still embarrassed. And I’m really glad we wear masks. Ok, back to physics. <br><br> -- <br><br>Class is over finally. Thank God. <br><br>
            We leave the room, and his backpack is unzipped. Is this another conversation starter? Yes it is, and I’m taking it. It’s better than before. I tap 
            him and tell him. And then it’s awkward. Wonderful. <br><br> But then he asks me my name. And I tell him. Then, I ask him his name.<br><br>'O'<br><br>
            It’s a pretty name.<br><br>And we’re headed our different ways now. But that’s it.

        <p>
            It is thursday, October 7. And today is our linear algebra exam. And I am screwed. I am going to die. I know absolutely nothing. A meets up with me 
            in the library and teaches me L’Hopital’s Method and something. And I sort of get it. And we’re off to the auditorium where others wait. <br><br>
            Wait a minute - <br><br> Is that O? Looks like him, could be. Let’s find out. A follows me, and I go up to him. <br><br>“O?” <br><br> He says my name.
            And I nod, pleased he remembered my name. <br><br> A insults me, asking if I have friends. Well no duh asshat, what was she then? My pet?<br><br>
            I’m about to say something to him, but A tells me F’s here. She’s here? But I don’t want to leave him alone? Ugh. <br><br>“I’m coming right back.” 
            I promise him as A drags me to the bathroom where F is panicking. I know I should be panicking as I know I’m failing, but I’m calm. Maybe because I 
            know it's too late to do anything.<br><br>We’re back. And we all go inside the auditorium as I introduce F and A to O. And they talk about the exam.
            We put our stuff together and take seats. I look at the exam. <br><br>And I’m fucked up. I know nothing.<br><br> ----- <br><br> That exam was terrible.
            It was beyond words. That terrible. Gods, I don't even want to think about it anymore. 
        </p>
        <br>______<br><br><br>
        <div id="f2021e6"><em>entry # 6</em></div>
        <p>
            So today is the day of the physics exam. I look at the exam, and the only thing I know is my name. I want to cry and give up. Thank God they gave us 
            formula sheets. Otherwise, I don’t even know anymore.<br><br>Okay, so I think I know how to answer this question. I remember how to do it - vaguely. 
            I write down the equations and put in the numbers. I use my calculator and oh my god I hate scientific calculators so much. Why the fuck can’t we use
            graphing calculators? Like I keep on erasing my answer, and forgetting it. And we can’t store answers as variables.<br><br>Grr. And I don’t know what
            I’m doing. <br><br> My answer is 4509 N. And the answer choices are 43N, 25N, 16N, 30N. Well 4509 is closest to 43 right? Let’s bubble that.<br><br>
            And I don’t know how to answer any of the questions. <br><br> Ok, ok. I’m okay. I’m okay. I’m not going to die. No, I am going to die. I’m 19 and I’m 
            going to die.<br><br>You know what, you know what? I’m done. I’m so fucking done.<br><br>Fuck this shit. I put answer choices on my eraser, and roll it.
            <br><br>Okay, for number 1, it’s choice A. <br><br> For number 2, it’s choice C.<br><br>For number 3, it’s choice B. And I go on. <br><br>Okay I’m on the
            last question, question 10. Maybe I should try to answer this question. I look at it, and I am so lost. Screw it, I’m putting C. I never want to do 
            this again.<br><br>I pick up my papers and hand it to the lady in the front and all but run out of the room, relieved it’s over.

            Hi, it’s me. Remember how I said data structures wasn’t going to be too bad. Well, guess what. I lied. I lied. <br><br>So on the first day I understood 
            what he was saying and what he drew. I, of course, got tired and ended up taking a nap for like fifteen minutes. <br><br>

        <h2>FALL SEMESTER</h2>
        <div id="f2020e1"><em>entry # 1</em>
            <p>Today’s Friday, the first friday of the semester, my college semester. This week, it’s been okay I guess. 
                But today, I need to go in person for chemistry lab. I have all my stuff - my printed lab, pencil and all. I should be good.
                Why do I have anxiety? I don’t want this. Grr. Whatever. Okay train time. Sixteen stops later, I’m finally at school.
                <br><br>Let’s find out where the room is. Wait, there’s a security guard here. Let me just ask her. Smart thinking over hardworking. 
                Big brain energy. She leads me to the room and I thank her. And there’s people inside already.<br><br>I sit in the second to last row and look around to see if there are any cute guys. 
                Yes I am like this. I’m not denying it. There’s like two cute guys, I admit. Anyways, there’s an asian girl besides me. 
                I think I’d like to be friends with her. Except social anxiety! Okay, I’ll try later on. But I’m not promising myself anything.<br><br>
                The professor is really nice and pretty too. But she’s really nice. I like her vibes, and she’s just really nice. And she knows what she’s talking about too. 
                Today we’re just going over lab rules and all. It’s an easy day today. That’s nice. 
                Ooo, time to go to lab. And we’re going upstairs. Don’t you just love exercising at 9 am in the morning? What better way to start the day?

        <p>
            Okay look, first thing your should know about me is to no trust me. Do not, and I seriously
            mean this, deadass I mean this - do not ever, E - V - E - R, take me as your role model.
            I am a terrible one. I'm being so serious when I say this. 
            <br><br>
            Okay look, so all my classes are online, right? Thank God for that too by the way. I would
            never want to take Calculus 2 in person. I think I would actually die from all the math.
            Right well, anyways, back to what I was saying. 
            <br><br>
            Do not take me as your role model. Why am I saying this> Because I love to go on my phone.
            And naturally I'm going to use my phone's alarm to wake me up for class, right?
            Well guess what bitches? 
            It's not even the third day of classes, and I'm going on my phone unil 7 am, and my class is
            at 9 am. 
            <br><br>
            Fuck myself.
        </p>
        <br>______<br><br><br>
        <div id="s2021e2"><em>entry # 2</em></div>
        <p>
            Ok, so in terms of my classes. Well, let's just say it's a good thing my classes are online.
            Because I don't know what the fuck I am doing. I'm being so serious right now. I have no idea
            what the fuck is going on in any of my classes. I pretty much zone out of all my classes right
            after I click on the Zoom link. I make sure my mic and camera are off. I either go to sleep. 
            Or I go on my phone, or I go on my laptop, doing who knows what.
            <br><br>
            Dear God, why the fuck do we have be in groups already? Shit, I should not curse. 
            <br><br>
            Hey God, sorry about that. But it's just the first week of classes, why are we going into groups already?
            Like what are we supposed to talk about?
            <br><br>
            This semester is going to be absolutely wonderful.

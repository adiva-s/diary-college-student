        <h3><em>i'm gonna be honest with y'all, but I have no idea what the <strike>#*!?</strike> I'm doing.
            tbh, i'm kinda impulsive like this.  I will admit. but, basically, I thought it would be
            a neat idea to type up my life story on the internet. Instead, I'll make it like a journal, 
            because I don't do diaries.<strike>That's too girly.</strike> That sounds rude. Okay, no well 
            I just don't vibe with it. Right, plus this could be therapeutic, maybe, who knows. Right, well 
            the thing is, I actually have a <strike>good</strike> selective memory. I can remember stuff from 
            two years ago but I cannot tell you what I had for breakfast this morning, which was literally ten 
            minutes ago. I want to say I had cereal, but I know for a fact, that I finished all the cereal two 
            weeks ago, and I'm too lazy to buy another box. So yeah. <br><br> Anyways! This is going to be updated
            randomly. Mainly because it's fun that way, plus, I don't remember a lot of stuff. But then again, I 
            might remember something. Who fucking knows? I should, but I don't. Anyways, enjoy my hugely publicized 
            journal, that I for some reason decided to share with everyone like the <strike>fricking</strike> idiot I am.

        <p>
            Technically, I should not skip class. But, in my defense, I just was not in the mood to go to class. It was math class, specifically Data Analysis. 
            At the moment, we were learning about probability. I hate probability with a passion, more than I hate myself, which is saying something.<br><br>
            Don’t look at me like that. Besides, I know better from last year. I will for sure try to learn everything on my own. I cannot afford to be on 
            academic probation this year. My GPA cannot handle it. It’s already threatening to fall. <br><br>But yes, going to class is a lost cause because 
            the train was delayed and came late. So really, it’s not my fault. This is just a sign for me to not go to class. This is God’s way of telling me 
            I shouldn’t go to class. I’m just listening. <br><br>So that’s why I’m here on my phone, doing more important stuff, like watching Tiktok. 
            There’s just something about Tiktok, appealing and yet wasting my time. But it really is my fault for wasting my time when I should be studying 
            or something. <br><br> Whatever. That's future me’s problem. <br><br>Ok, ok, it’s ten minutes later. And I should actually do some work. I turn on
            my laptop and go to my emails, like a responsible adult would do.<br><br>But then, I get sucked into the world of fanfiction, specifically Harry 
            Potter fanfiction. But to be honest, can you really blame me? Like it’s Harry Potter? It’s Ao3, we’re talking about?! They have some of the best 
            fanfictions out there. And like it is a work I’m subscribed to, so it does deserve my attention unlike school work. <br><br>At least fanfictions 
            make me happy, and isn’t that what’s really important - to do what makes you happy. <br><br>It’s fifteen minutes later, and I’m mourning the fact 
            that there’s no more chapters left. I ended up rereading the entire  fanfiction two more times, though there weren't a lot of chapters, in all 
            honesty.

            Holy shit. So like remember how I barely go to math class because I just hate probability. And I just cannot understand it for my life. 
            <br><br>By the way, I did study in the end. When I got home, I would end up studying it and learning it. I even watched Youtube videos,
            and read the the fucking textbook. But like guess what, guess what! Okay, so I’m in class, of course I’m not paying attention. 
            If you haven’t learnt by now, I barely pay attention in class. But I’m opening up brightspace, and I’m checking the little bell because 
            it has the red dot so I have to check it or it will annoy me forever. <br><br>Holy shit. Holy shit. So like you know how I just don’t go 
            to data analysis because like I said, I just hate probability with my entire soul. Right, well, I got an 81 on the exam, a B-. <br><br>Holy 
            shit. This is amazing. I’m actually proud of myself. I did not think that was going to happen. Because I expected to get a C or a D. <br><br>
            Wait a minute, let me check Gradescope to see if they uploaded the exam. I always forget my username and password, so like I have to guess 
            my password. And sometimes it’s a hit or miss. Otherwise, I just reset my password.<br><br>Okay, I’m logged in. Nice. Let me check it. 
            Woah, I actually got full points for questions I had no idea what to do. I say this because I remember for one of the questions I had no idea
            how to do it. Okay, so like my philosophy is that if I don’t know how to solve a question, I skip it and pray for the best. This was the first
            question too, so even better. But I remember that I got some inspiration, so I did something. And look at that, I got full scores on the question. 
            <br><br>Look at me, not going to class and still acing.<br><br>That’s magic.

            Okay, so today is my cs midterm - data structures. If you don't know this, I'm well retaking this class. Why, you ask? What a great question.
            The answer is that I'm a fucking idiot. I was off the rails last semester. But that's not the point of today's entry. But I did not fail the 
            class last semester. I did pass - barely - but I passed. But I did not meet the requirement to go to the next class. Because I'm a fucking
            disappointment, which we all know. <br><br> Anyways! I'm going to go take the exam, and this time I have been taking notes and studying
            and going over the practice exams. Okay, I'm heading inside the room now. Will type up later. <br><br> Okay! I'm done. I handed my papers in
            and here I am. Okay, so compared to last semester, I was not as hopeless, I feel like. I can confidently say for sure that I will not get a 
            12%. But if I do, let's just say you will never hear from me again. <br><br> --- <br><br> For legal reasons, that was a joke. <br><br>
            Okay, I'm going to go do hot student shit.
